# Description 

An android app for image classification. It uses EfficientNet-lite model to classify an image selected from storage.

The application uses [Tensorflow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) to load the model.

Model used efficientnet-lite0-fp32.tflite with 1000 Classes:

EfficientNet-lite are a set of mobile/IoT friendly image classification models. Notably, while EfficientNet-EdgeTPU that is specialized for Coral EdgeTPU, these EfficientNet-lite models run well on all mobile CPU/GPU/EdgeTPU.
